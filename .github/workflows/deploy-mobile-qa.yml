      # TEMPORARY: Using pre-built APK from Google Drive for rapid testing
      # ============================================================================
      # This workflow has been temporarily modified to skip the full Android build
      # process and download a pre-built APK from Google Drive.
      # 
      # Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16eWISdLN3TAhXRmVZ7jvo3GKDf89ey1U/view?usp=sharing
      # 
      # This saves ~5-10 minutes per workflow run while debugging Firebase App
      # Distribution upload issues.
      #
      # TO RESTORE FULL BUILD PROCESS:
      # 1. Comment out the "Use pre-built APK" step below
      # 2. Uncomment all the build steps (Install pnpm → Build Android APK)
      # 3. Update this comment block to reflect restored state
      #
      # ORIGINAL BUILD STEPS (currently commented out):
      # - Install pnpm
      # - Setup Node.js
      # - Setup Java 17
      # - Setup Android SDK
      # - Install dependencies (pnpm install)
      # - Decode Google Services JSON
      # - Run Expo prebuild (APP_VARIANT=quality)
      # - Build Android APK (./gradlew assembleDebug)
